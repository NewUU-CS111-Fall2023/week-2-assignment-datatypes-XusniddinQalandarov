Hello teacher

I have initially tried to solve the questions using the format you provided. However, I received an error from kali (OS that I am using). It stated (zsh permission denied. Cannot execute ./task_1.h).
I tried to solve it by searching for solutions online, yet nothing worked.

Hence, I solved each question in separate files. 

Please instruct me what to do in our next lab session.
